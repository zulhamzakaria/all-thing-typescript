// run tsc --init to turn a project to a TS project

/*
1. setting to define the proj root folder for compilation
2. "rootDir": "./src"
3. works together with "include" settings by telling TS to only compile files inside the defined rootDir
4. "include": ["src"]
5. use "outDir" for generated JS files like so : "outDir":"./dist"
6. generated/output files follow the same file structure
